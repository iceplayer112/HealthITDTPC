about
============
The Health IT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium ("HealthIT DTPC") is a collaboration of [constituents in healthcare and technology](https://github.com/iceplayer112/HealthITDTPC/wiki/Members) working to build a better system for secure, private data transfer with respect to healthcare data. Right now, policy and large businesses have built the framework for the secure transfer of health data.

After years of meeting with individuals, small businesses in healthcare and web software, and policy folks, it's clear the development of a web protocol is a more effective and efficient way to foster optimal privacy, security and the empowerment of the direct consumer in the transfer of health data.  This consortium is the effort to make that happen.  Our charge is to join in calling for this data transfer protocol's creation and architect elements in which best facilitate continuous transfer of healthcare data in high volumes to achieve the use-cases needed in everyday life for all constituencies involved (from small business to large; from a healthy patient to large institution).
