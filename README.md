about
============
The Health IT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium ("HealthIT DTPC") is a collaboration of [constituents in healthcare and technology](https://github.com/iceplayer112/HealthITDTPC/wiki/Members) working to build a better system for privacy, security and data transfer with respect to healthcare data. Right now, policy is dictating the creation of security and transfer.  After speaking with folks in web software, business and policy, we believe the development of a web-protocol is necessary to foster improved privacy, security and the empowerment of the direct consumer in the transfer of health data for the higher magnitude of advancements in clinical care.  We believe that a solution needs to be derived from the bottom-up rather than from a policy/big business-to-small business methodology.  Our charge is to join in calling for this transfer protocol's creation and arthitect elements which best facilitate continuous transfer of healthcare data in high volumes to achieve the use-cases needed in everyday life for all constituencies involved (from small business to large; from a healthy patient to large institution).
