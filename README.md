HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium

The HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium is an effort to build a better system for privacy, security and data transfer with healthcare data. Right now, policy folks are focused on HIPAA and making it more restrictive.  After speaking with folks in web software and business, we believe there is a better way to ensure the privacy, security and empowerment of the direct consumer in the transfer of health data.  Our charge is to better define that architecture and continue to call for its creation.
