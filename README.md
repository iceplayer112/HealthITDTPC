HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium

It's an effort to build a better system for privacy, security and data transfer with healthcare data. Right now, policy folks are focused on HIPAA and making it more restrictive... and there's a better way to do it. Imo, it's time for tech and businesses who suffer through HIPAA to call for a better solution and to make it happen
