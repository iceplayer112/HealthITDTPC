about the HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium ("HealthIT DTPC")
============
The HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium is a collaboration of constituents in healthcare and technology working to build a better system for privacy, security and data transfer with healthcare data. Right now, policy is dictating the creation of security and transfer.  After speaking with folks in web software, business and policy, we believe a web-protocol to foster improved privacy, security and the empowerment of the direct consumer in the transfer of health data is necessary and will come from the bottom-up rather than from policy-to-small business.  Our charge is to continue to call for this transfer protocol's creation and arthitect elements which the transfer protocol must contain to achieve the use-cases needed in everyday life.
