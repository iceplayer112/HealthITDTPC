about the HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium ("HealthIT DTPC")
============
The HealthIT Data Transfer and Privacy Consortium is a collaboration to build a better system for privacy, security and data transfer with healthcare data. Right now, policy is dictating the creation of a protocol.  After speaking with folks in web software and business, we believe there is a better way to ensure the privacy, security and empowerment of the direct consumer in the transfer of health data.  We believe this improved protocol will come from the bottom-up, rather than from top-down.  Our charge is to continue to call for its creation and arthitect elements which the transfer protocol must contain to achieve the use-cases needed in everyday life.
